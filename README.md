Interactive 3D Graphics class code

Note: three.js itself is constantly evolving. What we use here is a snapshot of three.js in lib/three.min.js.

Changes between the current three.js code, r58, and this repository:
* renderer.setClearColorHex should be changed to renderer.setClearColor (this is not backwards compatible).
* OrbitAndPanControls.js: use OrbitAndPanControls.new.js for three.js r58 on.
